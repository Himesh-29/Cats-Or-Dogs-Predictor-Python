# Cats-Or-Dogs-Predictor-Python

In this repository, I have created a machine learning model(CNN-Classification) which will detect that whether an animal is a dog or cat.
<p>Also, you can use any dataset containing images of cat or dog but make sure you change the <b>DIRECTORY</b> and <b>CATEGORIES</b> variable in the cleaning data notebook and set it according to your path of cat and dog dataset
 </p>
Just clone this repository using <code>https://github.com/Himesh-29/Cats-Or-Dogs-Predictor-Python.git</code>, open jupter notebook and just run all the cells.

### Note: Install the required python package using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
